What is 3LOD or 3 lines of defense framework in GRC?
Codified by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in its 2011 Principles for the sound management of operational risk, the three lines of defence is a risk governance framework that splits responsibility for operational risk management across three functions. Individuals in the first line own and manage risk directly. The second line oversees the first line, setting policies, defining risk tolerances, and ensuring they are met. The third line, consisting of internal audit, provides independent assurance of the first two lines.

What is the first line or first line of defence in the 3LOD?
This is formed by managers and staff who are responsible for identifying and managing risk as part of their accountability for achieving objectives. Collectively, they should have the necessary knowledge, skills, information, and authority to operate the relevant policies and procedures of risk control. This requires an understanding of the company, its objectives, the environment in which it operates, and the risks it faces.


What is the second line or the second line of defence in the 3LOD?
This provides the policies, frameworks, tools, techniques and support to enable risk and compliance to be managed in the first line, conducts monitoring to judge how effectively they are doing it, and helps ensure consistency of definitions and measurement of risk.  The second line comprises risk management and compliance functions to help build and/or monitor the first line of defence controls and typically report to senior management. 

What is the third line of the third line of defense in the 3LOD?
The principal function of the third line is to provide risk assurance. Internal audit provides assurance on the effectiveness of governance, risk management and internal controls, including first and second line controls. Internal audit is independent of management with a direct reporting line to the Governing body/ Audit Committee.  Tasked by, and reporting to the board / audit committee, it provides an evaluation, through a risk-based approach, on the effectiveness of governance, risk management, and internal control to the organizationâ€™s governing body and senior management. 

How are controls implemented within riskAI?
Controls are implemented via workflows in riskAI.  They should ideally follow the 3LOD framework.
