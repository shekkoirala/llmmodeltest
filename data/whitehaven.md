[]{#_Toc1 .anchor}INTRODUCTION

[Whitehaven Asset Management Inc. (referred as]{.smallcaps} the
"Company") is registered in the provinces of Quebec and British Columbia
as a Portfolio Manager (referred as PM). The head office being located
in the province of Québec and the Autorité des marchés financiers (the
"AMF") acts as principal regulator of the Company. It is the Company's
policy to comply with the laws and regulations, including supervisory
conditions and commitments that apply to its business. These policies
and procedures are intended to ensure such compliance. Advising
Representatives are referred to as "Representative(s)". Regardless of
position, all officers, employees and Representatives (collectively
referred to as "Members" and individually, referred to as a "Member") of
the Company must comply with applicable legal and regulatory
requirements and maintain high standards of business conduct and
personal integrity.

The Company's Compliance Policies and Procedures Manual (referred as the
"Manual") sets forth controls, established by the Company's management,
that provide a framework for compliance with legal and regulatory
requirements applicable to the Company as registrant under the
securities legislation. The Manual has been created to ensure that the
highest standards of governance are met in the ongoing management of all
PM Client portfolios. In addition, the rules and internal controls
provided for in the Manual are intended to permit the identification of
non-compliance items at an early stage with a view to correct the
non-compliant conduct in a timely manner. Copies of the Manual have been
given to all Representatives, who are responsible for knowing and
complying with the policies and procedural requirements contained
therein.

While we will endeavour to inform Representatives of changes to
securities laws, it is the responsibility of the Representative to
remain current with and understand all Company policies and procedures
and to comply with them accordingly.

The Chief Compliance Officer ("CCO") will coordinate and distribute all
amendments to the Manual. The Company's Representatives are to consult
with the CCO whenever they encounter compliance policies or procedure(s)
that may need clarification or amendment.

The Manual is the property of the Company and may not be distributed
outside of the organization without prior written permission from the
Company's CCO, except for examination by external regulatory agencies,
as well as the auditors of the Company. Representatives who terminate
employment with the Company are strictly forbidden from taking originals
or copies of the Company's records, including any manuals. Any
unauthorized release of the Manual or any of its contents may subject
the Representatives involved to disciplinary action.

A violation of law, regulatory requirements or the Company's policies
and procedures may subject the Representatives involved to disciplinary
action including dismissal. While every effort has been made to make
this a comprehensive document, it is not possible to address every
situation or set of circumstances herein. If there are questions or
uncertainties concerning regulatory requirements, the policies or
procedures set forth in the Manual or their applicability to a
particular situation or set of circumstances, Representatives should
consult with the CCO before taking any action. Any changes deemed
appropriate to the Company's policies and procedures will be implemented
and communicated to all Representatives by the CCO.

In the event any Representatives becomes aware of or suspects that a
violation of law, regulatory requirements or the Company's policies and
procedures has occurred, may occur or is occurring, such Representatives
must notify the CCO in a timely manner. The CCO will take appropriate
action, which may include reporting the matter to the Company's senior
management.

**POLICY ADMINISTRATIVE MATTERS**

The rules and policies included in the Manual apply to the Company's
activities; as such, the rules and policies apply to all officers,
employees and Representatives of the Company as determined by the CCO,
including for greater certainty all Registered Individuals.

The Manual shall be made available to all officers, employees and
representatives of the Company. On an annual basis, each subject
director, officer, employee and/or Representative shall be required to
sign the acknowledgment of receipt and undertaking at the beginning of
the Manual confirming compliance with the rules and policies set forth
in the Manual and submit it to the CCO.

The Manual will be amended from time to time as deemed necessary by the
CCO in response to significant corporate or business practice changes
and events, comments and issues raised in audits, examinations,
inspections, compliance testing or monitoring and the changes in
applicable legal or regulatory requirements.

The Company is registered in the National Registration Database ("NRD")
and all dealing Representatives of the Company are required to be
registered with the NRD once their appropriate qualifications are
established to the satisfaction of the Regulatory authorities.

**PM ACTIVITIES**

The PM provides discretionary portfolio management to each client
pursuant to a managed account agreement in accordance with that client's
investment policy statement. In most instances, the PM has an obligation
to assess whether a purchase or sale of a security is suitable for a
client before buying or selling the security for the client or at any
other time.

The fees paid by each client to the PM are set out in the client's
managed account agreement with the PM. All client securities are held by
third party custodians.

> Company Members must behave ethically and abide to the following:
>

> ethical manner with the public, clients, prospective clients,

> Representative, the Company must be sure that Clients clearly
> understand that their contract and legal recourse is with the Company
> and not with the Representative personally.

###  The Company and its Officers

> maintaining policies and procedures to ensure that its business is
> handled in accordance with the By-laws, Rules and Policies of the

[]{#_Toc30 .anchor} REFERAL ARRANGEMENTS

A referral arrangement is defined as "an arrangement whereby a third
party is paid or a Representative agrees to pay or receive a fee for the
referral of a Client to or from another person or entity." The CCO must
ensure that any potential conflict of interest is addressed through the
exercise of responsible business judgment influenced only by the best
interests of the Client. Clients must be given sufficient information to
understand the details of the relationship beforehand. Controls must be
put in place to ensure that Clients are not mislead as to the nature of
the relationship between the referring parties, or as to any licensing
limitations of the parties to the arrangements.

All referral arrangements whether or not Representatives receive a fee
or commission must be approved by the CCO before any Clients are
referred to the applicable person or entity. Representatives should also
record in their own books and records the fees and commissions they
receive or pay directly under approved referral arrangements.

Company requires the following processes to be followed for the two (2)
general types of referral arrangements:

[Securities Related Referral (i.e. deposit products):]{.underline} For
all Securities Related Referrals, not already approved by the CCO, the
Product Approval Request Form must be submitted to the CCO. This type of
referral will be reviewed by the CCO for approval. If approved, a
referral agreement between Company and the referral entity will be
entered into, for which all Representatives may refer Clients under.

[Non-Securities Related Referral (e.g. mortgage, tax, accounting,
legal):]{.underline} This agreement will be between the referral entity
and Company, on behalf of the Representative making the request.
Referrals are not to be made before the agreement is approved. For
Non-Securities Related Referrals where the Representative receives a
referral fee, the agreement must be signed by both the referral entity
and the Representative, and then submitted to the CCO for approval. For
Non-Securities Related Referrals where the Representative does not
receive a referral fee, the referral entity does not need to sign the
agreement. It would only need to be signed by the Representative then
submitted to the CCO for approval.

Pursuant to Regulation 31-103, a Representative must not participate in
a referral arrangement unless the following have been satisfied:

All referral arrangements, whether securities-related and non-securities
related, must be reviewed and approved by the CCO;

The Company is a party to referral arrangements entered into by its
Representatives;

Before a Client is referred by or to the Company or a Representative,
the terms of the referral arrangement are set out in a written agreement
between Company and the person or company making or receiving the
referral;

All referral fees received or paid by the Company under an approved
referral arrangement will be recorded on the books and records of
Company. As a best practice, Representatives should also keep their own
record of fees and commissions they receive under referral arrangements;

Where there are fees or commissions paid or received as a result of the
referral arrangement or there is a potential conflict of interest,
written disclosure of the referral arrangements is made to Clients
before the earlier of the opening the Client's account or any services
being provided to the Client under the referral arrangement.

**Reasonable Diligence**

A person that is party to a referral arrangement must take reasonable
steps to satisfy that the other party to the referral arrangement has
the appropriate qualifications to provide the services, and if
applicable, is registered to provide those services.

Representatives are not permitted to receive or pay fees in relation to
a referral of a Client except where such referral is made with the
knowledge and approval of Company. Representatives may only refer
Clients to an entity approved by Company.

Representatives are to conduct all securities related activities on
behalf of the Company and through the Company. Where a Representative
obtains KYC information to open an account at another dealer, the
Representative is acting contrary securities licensing requirements.

##  Third Party Service Providers

> The Company or a Representative may engage the services of any person
> including another Representative, to provide services to the
> Representative, as the case may be, provided that the Company and the
> Representative engaging the services remains responsible for
> compliance with any applicable legislation. The terms of service with
> the third party must be in writing and maintained on file before
> engaging in the services.

[]{#_Toc32 .anchor} INSURANCE REQUIREMENTS

##  Errors and Omissions Insurance ("E&O")

[]{#_Toc38 .anchor} NEW CLIENT APPLICATION FORM ("NCAF")

An agreement with a Client is initiated with the completion of a NCAF at
time of account opening. The agreement is binding when the Client, the
Representative, and the CCO have signed it. A NCAF with specified
information must be completed for each new account. It is very important
to note that, in addition to being contractually bound to the Client, a
Representative has a fiduciary obligation to act in the best interest of
the Client.

When a Client opens a new account, it is the responsibility of the
Representative to discuss KYC information definitions to ensure the
Client clearly understands each component of the form. The collection
and assessment of new Client information, including KYC information, is
required in order to determine a Client's investment objectives and
financial goals. The Company is expected to retain new Client
information in order to conduct trade suitability reviews. It is also
the responsibility of the representative to complete the client
investment policy and procedure (IPP). The IPP should be review annually
or in the situation of material change to the client situation or
objectives. The IPP should reflect the client objectives, risk
tolerance, special situation, the allocation of the portfolio the fee
schedule and procedure.

The CCO will review the NCAF and IPP for the following:

Ensure that all KYC information is current and has been inputted
properly;

Ensure that the risk levels and time horizon etc. are appropriate for
the Client given their other personal KYC information (i.e., age,
investment knowledge, net worth, etc.);

Ensure that where personal data seems inconsistent with risk tolerance
and time horizon, there are adequate notes to explain why the Client's
risk tolerance and time horizon are reflected as they are;

Ensure that the initial trade is suitable given the KYC information.

Both The Representative and the CCO should ensure that Client
information has been recorded properly and that all initial trades are
suitable given the Client's stated KYC information. For any instance of
incomplete or unsuitable information the CCO will issue an inquiry,
which must be addressed in a timely manner. Failing to do so may result
in a reversed trade and all associated costs will be borne by the
Representative.

The Representative must keep a copy of each Client's KYC, together with
supporting documentation. The original KYC document must be stored at
the Head office. A signed copy of the completed NCAF and all subsequent
KYC Updates must be provided to the Client.

##  NCAF Statement of Disclosure

> It is important that the Representative thoroughly review and explain
> all sections of the Statement of Disclosure to all Clients to ensure
> that they understand these issues. Obtaining a signed NCAF, which
> includes the Statement of Disclosure, and retaining it on the file for
> all Clients, will ensure that the Representatives have clear evidence
> that Clients have been informed of and understand these issues. These
> issues include but are not limited to the following:

description of the firm activities and relationship with client

privacy policy

suitability and types of products

complaint handling procedures

compensation disclosure

investment objectives and risk tolerance

referral arrangements and OBAs

account statements

##  Portfolio Management Relationship Disclosure Document

> statement outlining the following issues:

> These issues include but not limited to the following:

Investment Policy Statement

Standard of Care

Conflicts of Interest

Costs including Brokerage Expenses

Allocation of Investment Opportunities and Standard of Fairness

Proxy Voting

Reporting

[]{#_Toc41 .anchor} KNOW YOUR CLIENT FORM ("KYC")

It is the primary responsibility of the Representative to know the
essential facts relative to each Client and to ensure that each
portfolio recommended is suitable for the Client and in keeping with the
Client's objectives. Representatives must update the Client information:

Whenever the Representative becomes aware that there has been a material
change with respect to the Client;

Whenever a Representative takes over an account from another
Representative;

Whenever an account is transferred-in to Company;

The KYC document is the foundation document used to establish a
relationship between the Representative and the Client. Properly
completed KYC Forms set the minimum standard to adequately assess the
suitability of investment decisions for each plan. While it is valid
that a Representative considers the Client's overall financial situation
when recommending investment strategies, it is also important to
recognize that the Client may have a different investment objective,
time horizon and risk tolerance for different plans.

By detailing a KYC per plan, the Representative can better demonstrate
that they took the time to fully document the Client's situation prior
to making any investment recommendations. In addition, the Client, by
signing the KYC Update Form(s) agrees that the information for each plan
accurately depicts his/her situation. If a Client ever challenges the
Representative regarding his/her investment recommendations, the KYC
Update Form(s) will be an integral part of the Representative's defence
against any suitability claim.

##  Client Identity Requirements

> Name, address, date of birth, principal business or occupation of the
> individual/entity, type of Client ID, ID reference number, expiry date
> and place of issue must be collected for all Clients. Any piece of
> identification used must not be expired. When referring to a document
> to identify a Client, it has to be an original, not a copy of the
> document. Representatives must contact the CCO if an original copy
> cannot be obtained, to determine in what circumstances it will be
> permitted to rely on a notarized copy of an identification document.
> Acceptable forms of government-issued identification include: Birth
> Certificate, Driver's Licence, Passport, Record of Landing or
> Permanent Resident card, Social Insurance Number ("SIN") or other
> similar document issued by government entity.
>
> At the opening of a corporate account, the Representative must confirm
> the existence of an entity and keep record of the following, which are
> included in the confirmation of Identity form: Articles of
> incorporation including the business identification number ("BIN");
> Name and occupation of all directors of the corporation; and Name,
> address and occupation of all individuals who directly or indirectly
> own or control 25% or more of the shares of the corporation.
>
> When confirming the existence of an entity that is a not-for-profit
> organization, the Representative will need to determine and keep
> record of the following: Whether or not the entity is a registered
> charity for income tax purposes; or if the entity is not a registered
> charity, whether or not it solicits charitable financial donations
> from the public.

##  Collection of KYC Information

> A Representative must gather enough information from the Client in
> order to be able to provide investment advice by:

Using the current KYC Update form and completing the form in full. All
leveraged accounts must be identified as such on the KYC;

It is important that Representatives ask Clients about the source of
funds;

Ensuring the Client signs and dates the form(s);

Keep the form(s) in Client files to act as a permanent record of the
Client's instructions;

Ensuring the Client understands that it is his/her responsibility to
inform the Representative of any changes;

Ensuring that in the absence of the Client contacting the Representative
annually, the Representative can contact the Client in order to
ascertain whether or not there have been any material changes in their
affairs;

Updating KYC information and ensuring that all updated/amended KYC's are
faxed to the CCO or for approval.

> In the event of a complaint, the KYC is the first document to be
> scrutinized. An out dated or incomplete KYC Update cannot be relied
> upon to support the actions of a Representative Representatives must
> use the most current version of Company's KYC Update form. Any other
> version of the KYC form will be rejected.

##  Updating KYC and IPP

> Whenever a Representative becomes aware of a material change, the
> Client's KYC and IPP must be updated. Material changes may include,
> but are not limited to: Name, Residential address, Marital status,
> Employment/Occupation, Dependents POA, Income, Net Worth, Risk
> tolerance, Investment objective, Investment knowledge, Time horizon.
> The Client must initial all material changes made to the KYC Update
> Form.
>
> All changes to KYC information for Client accounts must be reviewed
> and approved by the CCO. If a Client undergoes a name change, the
> Company requires legal documentation be provided to evidence such a
> change (i.e. marriage certificate or other applicable legal document).

##  Maintaining Client Notes

> Maintaining a detailed and accurate record of Client instructions at
> the time they are given (or shortly thereafter) is an important
> internal control, which provides an audit trail for Company confirming
> transactions and assist in verifying trade details in the event of a
> dispute. A Representative's file is their main defence in the event of
> a Client complaint and regulators specifically request copies of
> Client files and meeting notes when reviewing a Client complaint or
> completing a regulatory investigation. Notes including a summary of
> discussions of meetings; a log of telephone conversations and the
> nature of each call; a log of unsuccessful attempts to contact
> Clients; copies of correspondence, emails and fax communications are
> all valuable tools in the event of a Client complaint. Many E&O
> insurance providers are now asking for details of note taking when
> renewing E&O policies and Client notes are requested when they assess
> potential claims. Representatives must keep such books and records,
> which shall contain an adequate record of each order, and of any other
> instruction, given or received for the purchase or sale of securities.
> Any person preparing or maintaining books and records as a service in
> respect of the business of Company or its Representatives shall be

> business.

> information provided by the client, WhiteHaven will help the client
> create their IPS, which sets out the client's:

investment objectives and guidelines;

time horizon and personal wealth components, which are used to develop
the applicable investment strategies;

risk tolerances;

appropriate asset allocation;

expectations in terms of the services to be provided to the client by
WhiteHaven; and,

investment performance to be monitored and reported.

##  Fee Schedule (Schedule A)

> The fees paid by each client to WhiteHaven are set out in Schedule A
> of his managed account agreement in the IPS with WhiteHaven. Each
> client should also review all of the documents related to their
> account to ensure that they understand all of the fees associated with
> their account. Each client should also carefully review the fees they
> have agreed to pay their custodian as set out in the applicable
> custodian fee schedule.

##  Suitability

> Pursuant to sections 13.3(1) and (2) of NI 31103, (i) the PM must take
> reasonable steps to ensure that, before it makes a recommendation to,
> or accepts an instruction from, a client to buy or sell a security, or
> makes a purchase or sale of a security for a client's managed account,
> the purchase or sale is suitable for the client; and (ii) if a client
> instructs the PM to buy, sell or hold a security and in the Company's
> reasonable opinion following the instruction would not be suitable for
> the client, the PM must inform the client of its opinion and must not
> buy or sell the security unless the client instructs the PM to proceed
> nonetheless.
>
> This requires the PM to have in-depth knowledge of all products that
> it buys and sells for or recommends to clients, including with respect
> to risk, key features and initial and ongoing fees and expenses. The
> foregoing requirements do not apply if the client is a registered
> firm, a Canadian financial institution or a Schedule III bank. In
> addition, the foregoing do not apply to the Company in respect of a
> Permitted Client if (a) the Permitted Client has waived (the
> "**Suitability Waiver**"), in writing, the requirements under these
> sections; and (b) the Company does not act as an adviser in Company
> respect of a managed account of the Permitted Client. The Suitability
> Waiver may be made under a blanket waiver for all trades.
>
> The CCO shall seek a blanket Suitability Waiver in writing from each
> Permitted Client of the Firm, to the extent applicable and shall
> maintain a record of these waivers.

##  Fairness Policy-Allocation of Investment Opportunities

> Product styles, client regulatory requirements and individual client
> restrictions differ greatly. In this regard, the policies and
> procedures are designed to provide a fair allocation of investment
> opportunities for all client accounts. It is the Firm's duty and
> policy to ensure that its directors, officers and employees deal
> fairly, honestly and in good faith with clients.

##  Available Securities

> In the course of managing a number of discretionary accounts, there
> arise occasions when the quantity of a security available at the same
> price is insufficient to satisfy the requirements of every client, or
> the quantity of a security to be sold is too large to be completed at
> the same price. Similarly, new issues of a security may be
> insufficient to satisfy the total requirements of all clients. Under
> such conditions, the trade allocation will be determined on a basis
> that is, reasonable and equitable to all clients and within the
> parameters of each client's investment objectives and their level of
> available cash resources. Trade allocations will be made by PM in a
> manner to avoid preference to any client over any other client.
>
> All trade allocations are made at the average execution price.
> Commissions, when charged, are also allocated on a pro rata basis
> based on the percentage of the entire order. In some instances, no
> commission is charged and a trade ticket fee is charged. In some
> instances, the total order may carry over more than one day and, in
> those instances, the executed portion will be the portion at the close
> of the total order whether filled completely or not.

##  Initial Public Offerings 

> For initial public offerings, other new issues and block trades where
> only a partial fill is received, trade allocation is based on order
> size and may result in accounts receiving an allocation that is
> inappropriately small for the size of that account. In these
> instances, trade allocation will also take asset size into
> consideration and some clients may not receive a pro rata share.
> However, at all times, every effort will be made at the next
> opportunity to compensate, so that each and every account, large or
> small, over time, receives equitable treatment in the filling of
> orders. The above sets out in general terms and standards of fairness
> that WhiteHaven will exercise in entering into trades on behalf of its
> clients.

##  Disclosure of Fairness Policy

> The Firm shall comply with the Fairness Policy and shall deliver to
> each client the Portfolio Management Disclosure Form: (a) when the
> Firm opens an account for the client; and (b) if there is a
> significant change to the summary last delivered to the client, in a
> timely manner and, if possible, before the firm next (i) purchases or
> sells a security for the client; or (ii) advises the client to
> purchase, sell or hold a security.

##  Proxy Voting 

> With most managed accounts, WhiteHaven generally has discretion as to
> how to vote the securities in a client's account. In exercising such
> discretion, and to minimize any potential for conflicts of interest,
> WhiteHaven 's policy is based on the premise that securities are only
> voted in the best interests of its clients. WhiteHaven also does not
> invest in securities of issuers in order to exercise control over, or
> to participate in, the management of those issuers.

##  Prohibition against Trading on Privileged Information

> No Member or Affiliate (as defined below) shall purchase or sell
> securities while in possession of information that has not been
> disclosed to the public and that could affect the decision of a
> reasonable investor to purchase or sell the securities ("**Privileged
> Information**").
>
> No Member or Affiliate (as defined below) of such Personnel shall
> inform, other than in the necessary course of business, another person
> or company of Privileged Information with respect to the securities
> before the Privileged Information has been generally disclosed.
>
> An "**Affiliate**" of the Member means:

any company in which the Member beneficially owns, directly or
indirectly, or has a controlling influence over voting securities
carrying more than a 10% equity interest and/or more than 10% of the
voting rights attached to all voting securities of the company for the
time being outstanding;

any partner of the Member;

any trust or estate in which the Member has a substantial beneficial
interest or as to which such Member serves as trustee or in a similar
capacity;

any relative of the Member who resides in the same home as the Member;
or

any person who resides in the same home as the Member and to whom that
person is married or with whom that person is living in a conjugal
relationship outside marriage.

> Privileged Information includes information deemed to be not generally
> disclosed (non-public) and material in nature. Information is
> considered to be not generally disclosed to the public if it has not
> been disseminated to the general public or the trading community by
> way of a major wire service or news agency, a filing with a regulatory
> agency, a widely circulated publication, or by other means.

##  Brokerage Expenses

> When placing an order for and on behalf of a client account, the PM
> will use those brokers and dealers who in its opinion can provide it
> with best execution (after considering all transaction costs and
> research or other benefits).
>
> The Company's general policy in selecting a broker or a dealer to
> effect a transaction on behalf of a client is to seek to obtain prompt
> and efficient execution of the required trade at the best obtainable
> price with payment of reasonable commissions or spreads in relation to
> the value of the brokerage services provided. Factors that may be
> considered when selecting an approved broker or dealer for a specific
> transaction may include:

brokerage services provided by the broker or dealer, including
execution, capability, commission rate,

willingness to commit capital and responsiveness;

the nature of the market for the security;

the timing of the transaction;

the quality of the services rendered by the broker in other
transactions; and,

research products and services provided by the broker or dealer (where
and when appropriate).

> For transactions in fixed-income securities, brokers and dealers are
> selected on the basis of security price, availability of the security,
> coverage of the security and the quality of research.
>
> External research provides a diverse perspective on the financial
> markets and can assist the PM in providing superior advice to PM's
> clients. Any research PM receives from brokers and/or dealers is used
> for the benefit of all of the Company's clients. In most cases the
> cost of these services is embedded in the commissions paid to the
> brokers or dealers to execute portfolio transactions on behalf of the
> Company's clients. Although such brokers or dealers do not necessarily
> charge the lowest commission on such trades, the PM will still enter
> into such trades in accordance with applicable securities law
> requirements when it is of the view that such brokers and dealers are
> providing best execution and the value of such research and other
> services for its clients exceed the incremental cost of such
> commissions. Please refer to "soft-dollar" commissions below

##  Soft Dollar Commissions

> The Company may from time to time and in accordance with applicable
> laws and regulations, direct brokerage transactions to brokers in
> return for the provision of goods or services, other than certain
> goods and services, such as research advice or reports.

##  Oversight of Service Providers (including Custodian)

> The CCO should take steps to ensure that outsourced functions
> (including those provided by a trustee, custodian, recordkeeper,
> investment advisor and valuation agent) are being done in a timely,
> accurate and competent manner including, to the extent commercially
> reasonable, the following:

obtain a service agreement with each service provider that has been
prepared and reviewed by [UDP]{.underline};

ensure that an independent auditor performs an independent report on
internal controls for each third party service provider on an annual
basis;

ensure that the funds managed by the Company will be indemnified for
losses resulting from service providers' actions or omissions;

be aware of any litigation or investigations pending which relate to the
service being provided by the third party service provider; and

review the transaction activity and services provided on a regular
basis.

##  Compliance Review and Trade Reconciliation

> The CCO or a designated officer should perform compliance reviews on a
> regular basis. This includes: meeting with the service providers to
> discuss service procedures and their compliance processes; regular
> operational meetings or calls to identify any ongoing or immediate
> issues; a continual review of the information, including reports,
> provided by the service provider and tasking operational staff to
> perform reconciliations, spot audits and reviews of service standards.
> The operational staff will be asked to confirm the third party's
> compliance of its obligations under material agreements and the
> accuracy of its recordkeeping. They will report to their direct
> supervisor and/or the CCO immediately upon any discrepancy in their
> review. The CCO will determine the best course of action in the event
> of such a discrepancy.
>
> The CCO or a designated officer of the Firm will maintain records that
> evidence this monitoring of the performance of these third parties,
> including:

reconciliation of procedures;

specific testing procedures; and

monthly review of transaction activity.

> All of this is intended to ensure that third party service agreements
> are adhered to in the appropriate manner. Any deviations should be
> followed up on immediately and records should be kept reflecting the
> outcome of such follow-up.

2.  []{#_Toc60 .anchor} TYPES OF ACCOUNTS

The following lists the different types of accounts:

##  Individual Accounts

> Individual accounts belong to one individual and no other name appears
> on this type of account unless there is a POA. If there is a POA, a
> notarized copy must be obtained disclosing the name(s) of the
> holder(s) of the POA. When setting up an individual account, the
> investment decisions should be based on the beneficial owner's goals
> and objectives.

##  Joint Accounts

> Joint With Rights of Survivorship ("JTWROS") -- in certain
> jurisdictions, upon death of one of the Clients, the remaining Client
> acquire equal ownership of the account by right of survivorship
>
> Joint Tenants in Common ("JTIC") \[Quebec only\] -- each Client owns a
> specific portion of the assets and upon death of one Client; the
> deceased's share goes to his/her estate. The remaining Client retains
> their portion of the account.
>
> When an account is held in joint names, the KYC information should be
> based on the information provided by all Clients. Additionally, all
> Clients must sign a joint KYC, agree to information sharing, and
> provide consent to disclosure for Privacy purposes to open the
> account/plan.

##  Corporate

> A corporate account is established for a business/holding company. The
> identification of the corporate officers authorized to trade on the
> account must be verified and identified on the KYC/Confirmation of
> Identity and verified with current, government-issued identification.
> When an account is corporately held all KYC information should be
> based on the company with the exception of the investment knowledge,
> which should be based on the knowledge of the authorized trading
> officers.
>
> In addition to the KYC, the Representative shall obtain:

A certified copy of the Articles of Incorporation or a Certificate of
Incorporation;

A certified copy of the Directors' Resolution authorizing the opening of
the account;

A list of those persons authorized to provide investment instructions,
properly certified in accordance with the Directors' Resolution;

A list of the corporation signing officers with specimen signatures;

The Representative must record the name, address and occupation of all
individuals who own or control, directly or indirectly, 25% or more of
the entity; and

The names and occupations of the directors must be recorded.

##  Not-for-Profit Corporation

> In the case of an entity that is not-for-profit organization, the
> Representative must indicate as such on the KYC and:

Determine whether or not that entity is a registered charity for income
tax purposes and keep a record to that effect. Representative can either
ask the Client or consult the Charities listing on the website of Canada
Revenue Agency.

If that entity is not a registered charity, Representative must
determine whether or not it solicits charitable financial donations from
the public and keep a record to that effect.

##  In-Trust for Minors

> Typically trust accounts are opened for minors by their parents,
> grandparents or guardians. When an account is held "in trust for"
> ("ITF") a minor, all KYC information should be recorded based on the
> primary Client(s) (e.g. mother, father, grandparent, or other trustee)
> as this person is the trustee. The trustee must therefore provide
> their name, address, city, and province, date of birth, occupation,
> driver's license ID, annual income, net worth, and investment
> knowledge. This information establishes who is responsible for the
> account. The beneficial owner (i.e. trustee) of the account must also
> be verified (i.e. SIN, birth certificate). The investment objective,
> time horizon and risk tolerance should, however, reflect those of the
> beneficiary of the ITF account and not the trustee's own investment
> objective, time horizon and risk tolerance.
>
> The SIN assigned to the ITF account should be that of the individual
> who is responsible for reporting any taxable income on the account.
> Canada Revenue Agency's attribution rules should be considered.
> Trustees should seek their own income tax advice on this matter.
>
> The trust may be formal or informal. A formal trust is established by
> a written trust agreement (Trust Indenture), which names a trustee who
> has authority to make decisions with respect to the account. In this
> case, the Representative shall obtain a copy of the trust agreement.
> Where no formal trust agreement has been entered into, the arrangement
> is simply informal and an ITF individual need not be named. The use of
> 'ITF' after the trustee name will indicate it as an informal trust.
> The name, SIN and date of birth of the ITF individual must be recorded
> on WinFund or any alternative system in use at the Company.

##  Registered Retirement Savings Plan ("RRSP")

> When opening a RRSP account, a Representative must record the amount
> of the initial contribution, the source of the initial contribution,
> and the designation of beneficiary (except for residents of Quebec).
>
> If spousal contributions are to be made in a RRSP, the appropriate box
> on the Investment Application must be checked and the name and spousal
> information must be completed in its entirety, including occupation
> and Client identity. The name of the spouse alone is not sufficient.
> Clients must have a valid SIN in order to open an RRSP account. A
> minor (i.e. younger than 18) who earns income may open a registered
> account in their name if they have a valid SIN.

##  Registered Retirement Income Fund ("RRIF")

> The time horizon should reflect the expected duration of the plan and
> not the individual withdrawals.

##  Locked-In Retirement Account/Locked-In Registered Savings Plan ("LIRA/LRSP")

> Locked-in accounts must have the following information:

NCAF/KYC Update form;

Signed locked-in agreement;

Signed spousal waiver (if applicable); and

Portion of commuted value of assets (if any) being transferred to the
LIRA/LRSP.

##  Registered Education Savings Plan ("RESP")

> When setting up a new RESP account, the RESP information must include
> the beneficiary's SIN number.

##  Registered Disability Savings Plan ("RDSP")

> If the beneficiary has reached the age of majority and is legally able
> to enter into a contract, then an RDSP can be established for such a
> beneficiary by the beneficiary and/or the legal parent who is, at the
> time the plan is established, a holder of a pre-existing RDSP of the
> beneficiary. If the beneficiary is a minor, another person can open an
> RDSP for the beneficiary and become a holder if that person is:

A legal parent of the beneficiary;

A guardian, tutor, or curator of the beneficiary, or an individual who
is legally authorized to act for the beneficiary;

Or a public department, agency, or institution that is legally
authorized to act for the beneficiary.

##  Tax Free Savings Account ("TFSA")

> To be eligible for a TFSA the Client must be a resident of Canada.

##  Estates

> When a Representative is notified that a Client has passed away, the
> Company and the fund companies must be informed. All trading on the
> account must cease until the account can be changed to an "estate"
> account. This will be done once all the necessary estate documents
> (including the authorized executor to deal with the account) have been
> received. An updated KYC must be completed to reflect that the account
> is an estate account. If there is a POA on the account, that POA is no
> longer effective after the death of the Client and no trade
> instructions may be accepted from the Attorney.
>
> Required documentation to be sent to the head office for Estates
> includes but may not be limited to:

Death Certificate

Last Will and Testament

Letters of Probate

New NCAF for Executor(s)

> If there is no will, a notarized letter of administration and a Letter
> of Direction for the designated beneficiary are required. In this
> case, the fund company should be contacted.

[]{#_Toc73 .anchor} PRESCRIBED FORMS & POWER OF ATTORNEY

##  Company Prescribed Forms

> Only Company prescribed or approved forms may be used when processing
> trades. Representatives may not modify Company standard forms in any
> way. All non-standard forms must be approved by CCO prior to their
> use. The use of non-approved Company forms is prohibited.

##  Power of Attorney, Trustee, Executor of Estate

> No Representative shall accept or act upon a general POA or other
> similar authorization from a Client in favour of the Representative or
> engage in any discretionary trading.
>
> Company Representatives are prohibited from accepting or acting upon a
> General POA or similar authorization (e.g. Executor of Estate,
> Trustee) for a Client of Company.
>
> Representatives may accept or act upon a General POA from immediate
> family members (spouse, parent or child) provided they cease acting as
> the Representative on Record before acting on the Power of Attorney.
> Another Representative will be servicing to the account.
>
> A Representative other than the Representative holding the General
> POA/Executor/Trustee must be the Representative of record on the
> account. Thus, the Representative code on the account must be
> different than the Representative code of the Representative holding
> the role of POA/Executor/Trustee.

##  Conditional Power of Attorney

> The Company has determined that if the POA is conditional (i.e., it
> can only be acted on in the event of incapacitation of the spouse,
> parent or child) the Representative can remain the Representative
> named on the account for a spouse, parent or child, until the POA
> becomes active. In order for Company to confirm that the POA is not
> currently in effect and is a conditional POA, the Representative will
> be required to acknowledge in writing that he/she will make
> appropriate arrangements to have the account transferred to another
> Representative prior to assuming the POA role.

##  Accounts with a named Power of Attorney, Executor, or Trustee

> Granting a new POA over an existing account is a material change. A
> New Client Application Form ("NCAF") or KYC update form must be
> completed for the Client named on all affected accounts to indicate
> the existence of the Power of Attorney.
>
> A separate NCAF for the POA collecting all necessary information about
> the Attorney must be completed and attached to the NCAF for the
> affected account. The Attorney's NCAF, together with all other
> necessary account documentation must be submitted to the CCO.
>
> Only the information described below must be provided on the NCAF for
> the individual acting under POA, Trustee or Executor of an estate
> account:

A copy of the legal document appointing the individual as
POA/Trustee/Executor must be provided;

The account number and all other information identifying the account
must be provided;

The POA/Trustee/Executor's name, address, telephone numbers, residence,
citizenship, and employment information must be provided. SIN, date of
birth and banking information are not required;

Provide POA/Trustee/Executor's Investment Knowledge;

And Confirmation of Identity for the POA/Executor for Anti-Money
laundering purposes.

> In addition to the POA/Trustee/Executor's information, the standard
> KYC information for the beneficial owner of the account must also be
> provided.

##  Trade Review

> In light of the extent of authority that can be exercised under a
> General POA, the Company has additional compliance controls than those
> required for trades placed pursuant to a limited trading
> authorization. In particular, the CCO will review each trade made
> pursuant to a General POA or similar authorization. The Company does
> not permit trades under a POA that will result in a transfer of assets
> to the person exercising the POA, even if under an account held
> jointly with the Client granting the power.

##  Identification of Trades/Accounts placed under a Power of Attorney

> In order to properly supervise trades made pursuant to a general POA,
> the Company must identify accounts for which a Representative holds a
> general POA.

1.  []{#_Toc80 .anchor} PRODUCT KNOWLEDGE & APPROVAL REQUEST

All Representatives must perform a reasonable level of due diligence on
each and every product on the Company product shelf. This means that a
review must be undertaken of each product and evidence of that review
must be maintained in the books and records of Company.

##  Product Approval Request

> A Representative who wishes to offer a product for sale that is not on
> the current Company Approved Product List must submit a product
> approval request to the CCO. The CCO will review the due diligence
> report and all applicable documentation in order to make a decision to
> approve or decline the product. Upon approval, the product will be
> added to the Company product shelf.
>
> Company may refuse to approve any new products or referral
> arrangements, including any mutual funds, notes or any alternative
> investment products. Therefore, Representatives should not offer
> products to Clients prior to Company approval.
>
> Company does not automatically review all new product offerings as
> they come out. Company will only consider, review and approve new
> products if requested by Representatives. Transacting business in any
> products that are not expressly authorized by Company shall be grounds
> for disciplinary action, which may include termination.
>
> Any trades placed for any unapproved product will be reversed at the
> Representative's expense.

[]{#_Toc82 .anchor} OUT OF PROVINCE

##  Out-of-Province Clients

> Representatives shall not solicit or in any way act in furtherance of
> a trade for Clients unless the Client is a resident in the
> jurisdiction in which the Representative is registered. Trades placed
> by Representatives not licensed in the Client's province of residence
> will not be processed, and the Representative will be subject to
> disciplinary action. If the Representative is not registered in a
> particular jurisdiction, the Representative must notify the Client in
> writing that they are not registered under applicable securities
> legislation to trade in mutual funds in the Client's jurisdiction of
> residence. The account will be placed on trade watch and restricted to
> redemption transactions only. Representatives registered with any
> Securities Commission, as a non-resident Representative must comply
> with all rules and regulations applicable in each jurisdiction of
> registration.

##  United States Residents

> In June 2000, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC")
> granted an exemption from broker-dealer registration for SRO Members
> and their Representatives dealing with U.S. residents, including
> Canadian citizens who are temporarily in the U.S. The exemption is
> subject to the following conditions:

No Open/Non-Registered accounts are allowed under any circumstance.

The account must be a taxed advantaged retirement account (RRSP, RRIF).

The account must be managed by the Client (i.e. the Client must select
or control the funds)

> On an annual basis it is the responsibility of the Representative to
> disclose to Clients that such accounts are not regulated under the
> securities laws of the U.S. and that Company is not subject to
> regulations in the U.S.. Company or the Representative must have a
> bona fide pre-existing relationship with the Client before he or she
> entered the U.S. Soliciting accounts from U.S. residents is not
> allowed. Company Representatives are not to advertise to or solicit
> U.S. customers.
>
> Representatives cannot make recommendations, transfers, switches or
> new purchases in Open accounts. It is in the Representatives best
> interest to advise Clients to transfer their Non-Registered account(s)
> to an institution that can service their financial needs. That being
> said, all U.S Clients with Non-registered accounts are restricted to
> liquidating transactions only.

##  Out of Country

> This information may change without notice. Representatives must
> contact the Company before setting up an account for an out of country
> resident to confirm current requirements.

2.  []{#_Toc86 .anchor} ACCOUNT TERMINATION PROCEDURES

At the end of the relationship with a Client, the Client's account will
be closed and its file retained by the Company in accordance with its
retention policy. If there has been no activity in an account for a
period of two (2) years, it shall be considered as having been closed
and the relationship terminated. Any renewal of the relationship will
require adherence to the new Client files opening procedure referred to
in this Manual.

[]{#_Toc87 .anchor} BANKING

##  Monies Received

> Representatives may only accept personal and corporate cheques, money
> orders and bank drafts. Representatives may not accept cash, third
> party cheques or traveler's cheques for any transactions regardless of
> size. Representatives should send copies of cheques for large
> purchases to Head Office before processing the trade. Cheques or Money

certified.

Purchases Over \$100,000 (U.S. Funds)

Cheques for amounts of \$100,000 USD or more cannot be accepted unless
certified.

> The purpose of this policy is to:

Secure the source of funds and ensure the integrity of the investing
public;

Protect Company and Representatives from the risks associated with
cheques being returned because of insufficient funds or fraud; and

Enhance the alarm level and reduce the risk of possible money laundering
crimes.

> Cheques MUST BE made payable to the custodian, mutual fund company,
> issuer or to the Self Directed Intermediary Accounts (e.g. MRS, B2B
> Trust, CWT). Client cheques must be received on the same day the
> purchase is to be made.
>
> The Canadian Bank System settlement policy is that five (5) business
> days are required for settlement of non-certified cheques. Therefore,
> Company cannot allow purchase transactions over \$250,000 if the
> purchase cheque from the Client is not certified. Further, multiple
> cheques submitted over a span of five business days may not exceed
> \$250,000.
>
> **Exceptions**
>
> Company does not accept post-dated cheques unless the Client has given
> specific instructions along with completed and signed documentation.
> If the Representative chooses to accept post-dated cheques with
> standing instructions and fully completed documentation they must
> ensure that the cheque is processed as per the Client instructions.
> The Representative will pay for any cost for delay in processing.
>
> **Reimbursement of Transaction Fees**
>
> When a Client transfers his/her self-directed plan from one
> institution to another, the releasing institution may assess transfer
> fees. Some Representatives prefer to take care of these fees for their
> Client. These fees cannot be treated as a commission rebate. Any fee
> reimbursements must flow through the books and records of the Company.
> Representatives are not permitted to compensate Clients directly.
> Representatives must complete the "Commission Rebate Disclosure Form"
> and indicate that the form is being used for "Reimbursement of Fees."

##  NSF Cheque Policy

> When Company is notified that a cheque issued by a Client has been
> returned as NSF, the Representative will be contacted and notified
> that the Client has 24 hours to issue a replacement cheque. If a
> replacement cheque cannot be obtained and deposited within 24 hours,
> then all the related trades will be cancelled. Charges incurred for
> reversing any trades will be charged back to the Representative.

[]{#_Toc90 .anchor} COMPLAINTS

Any complaint or claim against the Company or a Representative by a
Client or a Regulator must immediately be reported to the CCO. A
complaint can be verbal or written and may be threatened or actual.

##  Handling of Complaints/Procedure

[]{#_Toc100 .anchor} CONFLICTS OF INTEREST & PROHIBITED PRACTICES

Non-compliance with the provisions of this and the following sections of
the Manual is grounds for immediate dismissal of the Representative.

##  Full disclosure

> All Representatives must avoid actual or perceived conflicts of
> interest or conduct which creates the appearance of a conflict of
> interest. A conflict of interest is a situation which affects the
> independence and/or objectivity of a Representative or the Company or
> which conflicts with or affects the carrying out of Company's and the
> Representative's duties to the Clients and to the Company itself.
>
> Any conflict of interest should be avoided but should such conflict or
> potential conflict of interest be considered to be unavoidable or an
> issue, the Representative involved will fully disclose such conflict
> to the CCO and the Client whether in respect of a specific situation
> or in a broader context such as, by way of example only, posting the
> Company's conflicts policy on the Company's website or including it or
> extracts thereof in its marketing materials.
>
> The decision as to the manner in which such conflict will be disclosed
> and managed shall be determined by the UDP in consultation with the
> CCO.
>
> While it is not feasible to specify all the activities that may give
> rise to a conflict of interest, or the appearance of one, the
> following are examples of areas where such a conflict may appear.
> These are not exhaustive and do not limit the generality of the
> conflict of interest policy:

Personal investments;

Corporate opportunities;

Business affiliations;

Business entertainment and gifts;

Confidential information;

Fair dealing and integrity;

Accounting controls;

Discrimination and harassment;

Reporting of any illegal or unethical behaviour; or

Accepting appointments of and/or acting as POA, Executor or Trustee on
behalf of Clients.

##  Insider Trading/Tippee Policy

> Material information is information which would or could affect the
> decision-making process of a reasonable investor or information which
> could reasonably be expected to have a significant effect on the
> market price of Securities issued by the entity to which the
> information pertains.
>
> Such information is considered to be non-public until such time as the
> Issuer has disseminated the information to the general public in the
> manner approved by the Regulators. The Company or the securities
> legislation, do not permit Representatives to trade on the basis of
> non-public material information with respect to an Issuer. This
> applies to personal trading, tipping or trading on behalf of another
> person or entity.
>
> The CCO must be advised immediately when a Representative is in
> possession of non-public material information with respect to a
> Client.
>
> Insider trading is an offence under securities regulation and, in some
> jurisdictions, a criminal offense. The Company will not assist in the
> defence of any Representative accused of insider trading. The Company
> will in all circumstances be entitled to representation separate from
> the representation of any Representative implicated in the event of
> any allegations of insider trading or tipping.
>
> In the context of the foregoing prohibitions, communication to third
> parties, directly or indirectly, of material non-public information
> (sometimes known as "tipping") is prohibited.

##  Monitoring of Personal Trading

> All Representatives are subject to the monitoring or review of their
> personal trading accounts with the Company and with any other
> registered financial intermediary with which a Representative may have
> an account. All Representatives agree and undertake to authorize the
> release of information to the Company by such intermediary upon the
> request of the CCO. Trading in shares of Clients is a potential
> conflict of interest and must be disclosed to and approved by the CCO.

##  Trading Restrictions and Blackouts

> The Company will maintain, update and communicate a list of its
> Clients to all Representatives. The Company will also advise
> Representatives, from time to time, of Issuers in respect of which
> personal transactions are prohibited. This generally would be the case
> in connection with dealings with an actual or prospective Client and
> shall constitute a complete trading blackout unless the prior approval
> of the CCO is obtained before any trade.
>
> Occasionally, the Company and/or Representatives or Members of the
> foregoing may wish to participate directly in the financing of and the
> distribution of a Client's Securities. The Representative or Member
> must obtain the written permission of the CCO before subscribing for
> Securities in any such financing. If the Company itself wishes to
> participate in such financing, the CCO and UDP must approve its
> subscription and maintain a record of such decision.

##  Referral Arrangements Disclosure

> Occasionally the Company may be involved in the marketing of
> Securities of a Client or may be asked by other financial
> intermediaries to assist them in placing Securities in connection with
> a financing. A fee (included, but not limited to, a "split
> commission") will be paid to or by the Company on the basis of the
> dollar value of the Securities involved. These arrangements, known as
> "referral arrangements", may be entered into **only** by the Company
> and not by a Representative (unless prior approval of the CCO is
> obtained and the Company is a party to the referral agreement).
>
> The CCO must also review and approve all securities related referrals
> arrangements (e.g. Portfolio Managers or Investment Fund Managers)
> before any Client referral can take place.
>
> Securities legislation provides *inter alia* that details of the
> referral arrangement be in writing, that any conflicts of interest be
> disclosed, that the Investor be informed of such arrangement and that
> provision be made to separately record all referral fees, all of which
> requirements must precede the referral and the provision of any
> services to the Client.
>
> If a referral arrangement arises at the time of or subsequent to the
> opening of an account, Company shall distribute a Disclosure Statement
> to its involved Clients and to its involved Investors outlining
> Company's Fee Referral Policy.

16. ##  Personal Financial Dealings

    1.  ###  Borrowing or Lending from Clients 

> No Representative shall lend to, extend credit to, or borrow from any
> Client for any reason. Lending funds to or borrowing funds from a
> Client, regardless of the term, constitutes a conflict of interest and
> breach of business professionalism and will result in disciplinary
> actions and/or dismissal. Under no circumstances can a Representative
> write cheques to Clients.

###  Private Investment Schemes

> The Company prohibits the following types of arrangement:

Clubs in which the Representative and the Client invest together

Arrangements where Client funds are placed into investments that are
directly or indirectly managed by the Representative

Co-investments by the Representative and the Client in pyramid-like
schemes or other questionable investments

### 26.6.3 Monetary or non-monetary Benefits to or from Clients 

> It is prohibited for Representatives to accept cash from Clients.

> A Representative may under certain circumstances be involved in a
> business agreement as a partner, shareholder, director or officer of a
> business owned, co-owned or controlled by the Representative's Client.
> If Representatives are involved with or are contemplating this type of
> agreement, the activity must be reviewed by the CCO for any potential
> conflict of interest. As such, an OBA form must be submitted for
> review and approval prior to commencing the activity.

##  Acting Beyond Registration

> Representatives are prohibited from making the following
> representations:

A Representative shall not make any representations that he/she will
resell, repurchase or refund all or any part of the purchase price of
any investment unless the investment carries such a right.

A Representative shall not make any representation as to the future
value or price of any investment.

A Representative shall not make any representation as to guaranteeing
Client losses.

##  Conflicts Related To Exempt Securities of Non-Arms Length Issuers

> As exempt securities are not sold by way of prospectus, they are not
> reviewed by any regulatory authority prior to issue and are not
> subject to the same types of controls and disclosures as securities
> sold by prospectus. Therefore, with respect to exempt securities of
> non-arm's length issuers, even where there is disclosure of the
> inherent conflict to Clients, there may be circumstances where Company
> or Representatives would be able to demonstrate that the conflict has
> been adequately dealt with through the exercise of responsible
> business judgment influenced by the best interests of the Client.
>
> As stated in Regulation 31-103, the Company must take reasonable steps
> to identify any existing or potential conflicts of interest that in
> its reasonable opinion the Company would expect to arise between the
> Company and the Client. The Company must respond to any such existing
> or potential conflict of interest. If a reasonable Client would expect
> to be informed of such a conflict of interest, the Company must
> disclose to the Client, in a timely manner, the nature and extent of
> the conflict of interest. Representatives are prohibited from selling
> any unapproved product.

##  Internal Discipline

> All breaches of securities regulation, as well as Company policies and
> procedures may be subject to internal disciplinary procedures. The
> conduct of the Representative will be reviewed by the CCO to determine
> the type of disciplinary action that will be imposed. Types of
> disciplinary action may include one or more of the following:
> Reimbursement of costs to Clients or to Company; Warning Letter;
> Fines; Additional supervisory measures (i.e. Strict supervision); or
> Suspension or termination of employment.
>
> In all cases, a formal letter will be issued to the Representative
> outlining the disciplinary sanctions that will be imposed. This letter
> will be maintained in the Representative's registration file.
> Representatives must understand that a breach of Company's internal
> policies and procedures as well as non-compliance with Regulatory
> requirements is a serious offence that may warrant disciplinary
> action.
>
> Representatives placed under strict supervision must obtain
> pre-approval for all trading activity from the CCO.

##  Anti-Money Laundering

> The Company will not tolerate activities enabling money laundering or
> the funding of terrorist or criminal activities. The Company is a
> financial intermediary within the terms of, and is required to comply,
> with the legislation commonly referred to as the "anti- money
> laundering" law. The Company's KYC contains a section dealing with
> certain Investor information and documentation required in connection
> with this obligation. Completion of this section and obtaining the
> required documents are obligatory and the CCO will not approve a KYC
> without this documentation.
>
> In accordance with applicable legislation, certain transactions will
> be reported to the Financial Transaction and Reports Analysis Centre
> of Canada (FINTRAC) and all appropriate regulatory filings will be
> made.
>
> **Under no circumstances can a Representative accept cash on behalf of
> the Client.**

##  Securities related business

> No Member or Representative in respect of a Member shall, directly or
> indirectly, engage in any securities related business except in
> accordance with the following:

All such securities related business is carried on for the account of
the Member, through the facilities of the Member and in accordance with
the By-laws and Rules;

All revenues, fees or consideration in any form relating to any business
engaged in by the Member is paid or credited directly to the Member and
is recorded on the books of the Member".

##  Stealth Advising

> Stealth advising refers to a situation whereby a non-registered
> individual provides securities related advice without registration by
> executing trades through a registered individual. Stealth advising is
> prohibited. This is done without the approval of the Company. Under
> such arrangements, Client accounts are set up at the Company, with the
> registered individual as the Representative of record, and trading
> activity is processed using that individual's Representative code.
> However, a non-registered individual services the account, providing
> advice and making recommendations to Clients, and directing the
> registered individual to place trades. The non-registered individual
> receives compensation, which often takes the form of a portion of the
> commissions paid to the registered individual by the dealer.
>
> Representatives should be aware of potential stealth relationships
> when buying a book of business or if Clients are referred from another
> professional. Due diligence is required whenever Representative
> inherits Clients from another representative. Representatives engaging
> in activities that require registration, without proper registration,
> will be subject to sanctions by the Company or the applicable
> Provincial Securities Commissions.

> example, there should be three separate files for a husband's
> individual account, a wife's individual account and for the joint
> account.

##  Business Continuity Plan

> Representatives and its Clients will be backed-up at regular intervals

> Summary is also available for clients, upon request.

##  Storage Medium

> All records and documents are required to be maintained in writing or
> otherwise may be kept by means of mechanical, electrical, electronic

##  Record Destruction

> uniform manner on a predetermined schedule and should maintain a log
> of all documents destroyed with evidence of approval by another
> officer of the Company. It is not always clear which matters may be
> assessed by the tax authorities or become litigious. Therefore, it is
> the Company's policy to adopt a conservative approach when destroying
> correspondence.

> reviewed, and no changes have been made in a timely manner, the CCO
> will contact the Representative by telephone and via email, with a
> request that the site be immediately shut down.
>
> With respect to Representatives who may have their names listed on
> websites belonging to several industry Associations (e.g. CFP,
> Advocis, etc), it is the opinion of the Company that this exercise is
> a form of advertising, particularly when including the product (i.e.
> mutual fund) trade name. As a consequence, approval is required if you
> are currently listed on any website that could be construed as
> advertising. Representatives notify the CCO if this issue pertains to
> them. If a Representative intends to have their name and/or trade name
> indicated on a third party website, kindly contact our CCO to receive
> pre-approval.

##  Social Media and Blogs

> If a Representative uses social media for the purpose of business or
> marketing (i.e. not personal use) and has an existing profile or
> creates a new profile on a social media site such as, Facebook,
> LinkedIn, Twitter, or a similar site, the Representative must notify
> the CCO. Representatives must notify the CCO if they are engaging in
> the use of a social media site for business related purposes so that
> Company can keep a record of all Representatives actively using social
> media.
>
> The Company permits the use of social media sites and blogs for
> marketing and advertising. However, social media must not be used for
> acts in the furtherance of a trade with a Client. For example, a
> Representative must not give trade instructions or recommendations to
> a specific Client or the general public through the means of a social
> media site.
>
> All sales communications posted on social media sites must be
> submitted to the CCO for review before posted to the website. Sales
> communications used on social media sites and blogs will be subject to
> the same review process as all other sales communications. Such
> advertising must meet the same general requirements as sales
> communications used in other media, and no Representative shall issue
> or knowingly allow his/her name to be used in respect of any
> advertisement or marketing piece which:

Contains an untrue statement or omission or is false or misleading;

Contains any unjustified promise of specific results;

Uses unrepresentative statistics to suggest unwarranted conclusions or
fails to identify material assumptions upon which such conclusions are
based;

Contains any opinion or forecast of future events that is not clearly
labelled as such; Fails to fairly present the potential risks to the
Client;

Is detrimental to the interests of the public or Company;

Does not comply with applicable legislation; or

Implies that a Regulatory body has approved the content of the marketing
material.

> The same warning and disclosures required with other media are also
> required for social media.

##  Cold Calling

> Cold Calling is the practice of prospecting for investors by calling
> potential investors with whom Representatives have no previous
> contact. A Representative may be referred to a potential Client where
> they have not received express consent from that individual to be
> called and must follow the Rules and subscribe to the National Do Not
> Call List (DNCL). Consent can be given through email, a conversation,
> conventional mail, or a telecommunication initiated by the Client.

##  Disciplinary Sanctions

> All breaches of Company policies and procedures in regards to sales
> communications may be subject to internal disciplinary procedures.
> Disciplinary action may include some or all of the following:

Warning letter;

Fines;

Additional supervisory measures (i.e. Strict supervision); and

Suspension or termination of employment.

> Representatives must understand that a breach of Company's internal
> policies and procedures as well as non-compliance with Regulatory
> requirements is a serious offence that may warrant disciplinary
> action.

##  Compliance with French Language Laws

> The Company shall take all appropriate commercial measures to comply
> on an ongoing basis with the Charter of the French Language and the
> regulations enacted thereunder. In addition, to the extent the
> *Securities Act* (Québec) is applicable, any prospectus, document
> authorized by the AMF for use in lieu of a prospectus, offering
> memorandum prescribed by regulation, risk acknowledgement form
